# YouTube-Home-Layout

Copy of YouTube home

## This project is intended to copy the YouTube splash screen (layout only, no interactions).

### CSS GRID was used to position the div's on the screen and CSS Flex-box to manipulate the elements inside each row/column. @media was used for mobile responsiveness.
